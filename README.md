Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/rapidtriage


### Compile as Executable
-Install pyinstaller (pip install pyinstaller)
-Go to the directory where rapidtriage.py is located
-Run 'pyinstaller --onefile rapidtriage.py'

### Usage
-You can run this on a machine while its connected to the network to get some live traffic data, but I wouldn't recommend it. Unplug the machine from the network, run this as the current user, an elevated local user, or both; then analyze the results. Change passwords/clone the disk and reimage if needed for further analysis.
-Better tools probably exist now, this is old.
